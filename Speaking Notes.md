### Q46 - 0914

阅读不能快速抓住要点。

听力大致都能听明白。可是不能**快速组织语言**。有没有什么练习可以做啊。

这篇听力的形式是，两点对臭鼬的介绍 + 一个臭鼬大战野狼的例子。所以对于时间的控制是两点介绍说完应该至少还剩20’。

一个感受是，关注时间，至少要把关键词都踩到，不要在发音或者语法上苛求了。

Warning coloration means that some animals have a distinct coloring to remind the predators of their defense mechanism.

The professor elaborates on this by giving an exemple of skunk. First, skunk has a distinctive marking. Its body is mostly dark but with a white stripe runs from head to tail. In this way, skuns can be seen and recognized even at a far distance. Second, sunk can produce a bad-smelling liquid from the glands under their tail. For example, say a wolf wants to attack a skunk, and as the wolf approaches, the skunk will lift its tail and sprays the wolf, which makes the wolf very uncomportable so it backs off and run away. From then on, wnenever that wolf sees the marking of skunk, it will recall that unpleasant memory and stay away from it.

### Q47 - 0912

（According to the reading,） reactance means that in order to restore/regain freedom, people will directly oppose the regulation when their freedom is unfairly limited. The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples. First, imagine a kid who often goes to a playground and has a lot of fun. However, his parents suddenly don't allow him to go there anymore for no reason.  The kid thinks it's unfair and wants to play there even more than before. He will sneak to the playground despite the rule. Second, a town decided to ban the sale of a soap because an ingredient in it is harmful to the environment. But the clean ability of the soap is good.However, people became upset because they thought they should be able to buy whatever they what. As a result, a week before the policy went into effect, people went to buy a lot of this soap, way more than they would in other situations.
