#### 自我 

#### 家人 

##### 1.

**When** celebrating important events with my family, **I like to spend time making** new memories with them. For example, I could make them a meal that makes them happy, **or** we could go to a park or museum that they have been wanting to visit. I **would** take lots of photos, **so that even after** the event is over we can look back and see the happy memories. Physical gifts can break or become outdated over time, **but** memories can last forever and continue to make people smile for a long time after the event has passed. 





#### 朋友

## Task3 130-160

### Q46 - 0914

阅读不能快速抓住要点。

听力大致都能听明白。可是不能**快速组织语言**。有没有什么练习可以做啊。

这篇听力的形式是，两点对臭鼬的介绍 + 一个臭鼬大战野狼的例子。所以对于时间的控制是两点介绍说完应该至少还剩20’。

一个感受是，关注时间，至少要把关键词都踩到，不要在发音或者语法上苛求了。最重要的是回答内容的完整性。

Warning coloration **means that** some animals have a distinct coloring **to** remind the predators of their defense mechanism.

The professor elaborates on this **by giving** an exemple of skunk. First, skunk has a distinctive marking. Its body is mostly dark **but with** a white stripe runs from head to tail. **In this way**, skuns **can be** seen and recognized **even at a far distance**. Second, sunk can produce a bad-smelling liquid **from** the glands under their tail. **For example, say** a wolf wants to attack a skunk, **and as the wolf approaches**, the skunk will lift its tail and sprays the wolf, **which makes** the wolf very uncomportable **so** it backs off and run away. **From then on**, **wnenever** that wolf sees the marking of skunk, it will recall that unpleasant memory and stay away from it.

### Q47 - 0912

（According to the reading,） reactance means that in order to restore/regain freedom, people will directly oppose the regulation when their freedom is unfairly limited. The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples. First, imagine a kid who often goes to a playground and has a lot of fun. However, his parents suddenly don't allow him to go there anymore for no reason.  The kid thinks it's unfair and wants to play there even more than before. He will sneak to the playground despite the rule. Second, a town decided to ban the sale of a soap because an ingredient in it is harmful to the environment. But the clean ability of the soap is good.However, people became upset because they thought they should be able to buy whatever they what. As a result, a week before the policy went into effect, people went to buy a lot of this soap, way more than they would in other situations.

【应该用什么时态呢?】



## Task4

## 如何快速组织语言

想要口语说的流利，一定要进行**整句练习**，不然容易磕磕绊绊的。这个练习可以分成两方面：

对于一些**常用的句子**，多练，练到非常流利乃至想到就能顺口说出来的地步。比如学习中的“It's common that we are suffered from mental problems like [anxiety](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=anxiety&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra={"sourceType"%3A"answer"%2C"sourceId"%3A"2458811255"}), depression and lack of confidence.”这些句子出现频率高，说的流利些，考场上绝对是加分项。

对于一些**常见的句型**，多练，多用。知道我们能自然的将想表达的意思通过这类句型表达出来，就比如我们能很轻松的说“I like play video games”，这个很简单，但是我们要训练到能表达成“ Video games are quite attractive to me”就不是很容易了，需要多练，将这种物品做主语的句型练得熟练。
