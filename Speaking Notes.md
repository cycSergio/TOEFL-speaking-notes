### Q47

According to the reading, reactance means that in order to restore/regain freedom, people will directly oppose the regulation when their freedom is unfairly limited. The professor elaborates on this by giving two examples. First, imagine a kid who often goes to a playground and has a lot of fun. However, his parents suddenly don't allow him to go there anymore for no reason.  The kid thinks it's unfair and wants to play there even more than before. He will sneak to the playground despite the rule. Second, a town decided to ban the sale of a soap because an ingredient in it is harmful to the environment. But the clean ability of the soap is good.However, people think this is not right because they should be able to buy whatever they what. As a result, a week before the policy went into effect, people went to buy a lot of this soap, way more than they would in other situation.
